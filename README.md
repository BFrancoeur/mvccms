# MVC CMS

## The Problem:

We have a gazillion frameworks, libraries, and package managers, enough to overwhelm even the most seasoned developer. When something goes awry with any one of these items (I'm looking at you, NPM), there is chaos. Websites break, apps stop working, and the internet is temporarily under siege.

## The Solution:

Create a Content Management System (CMS) that doesn't use any package manager, library, or framework.

## Why Do This?

My hypothesis is that I can create a viable CMS that's just as fast and as secure as the popular frameworks and libraries in use today (think Laravel and React). At the end of the day, libraries and frameworks abstract away key functions. Sure, that makes development cycles a lot faster, but we are trading autonomy for convenience. How much money will be spent if Meta decides they want to make React closed source? What if the creators of Laravel decide that we should pay monthly subscription fees to use their framework? I believe in a free and autonomous internet experience, especially for developers.
